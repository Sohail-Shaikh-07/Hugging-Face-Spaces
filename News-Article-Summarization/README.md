# üì∞ News Article Summarizer

A powerful and efficient news article summarization tool powered by BART-Large-CNN model. This application automatically extracts and summarizes news articles from URLs, making it easier to quickly grasp the key points of any news article.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Article Extraction**: Automatically extracts article content from news URLs
- **Advanced Summarization**: Uses BART-Large-CNN model for high-quality summaries
- **Chunk Processing**: Handles long articles by processing them in chunks
- **Clean Output**: Removes unwanted elements like ads and navigation for better results
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple Gradio interface for easy interaction

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **BART-Large-CNN**: State-of-the-art summarization model
- **Gradio**: Web interface framework
- **BeautifulSoup4**: HTML parsing and content extraction
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face transformers library

## üìã Requirements

```
gradio==5.9.1
transformers

```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

1. **Article Extraction**:
   - Fetches article content from the provided URL
   - Removes unwanted elements (ads, navigation, etc.)
   - Extracts main article text

2. **Text Processing**:
   - Splits long articles into manageable chunks (1024 tokens each)
   - Cleans and prepares text for summarization

3. **Summarization**:
   - Uses BART-Large-CNN model for each chunk
   - Combines summaries for a coherent final output
   - Provides clean, readable summaries

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Processing time varies based on article length
- Look for "Running..." indicator while processing
- Wait patiently for best results
- Model can be changed to T5 or GPT-2 for different results
