# Hugging Face Spaces Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Hugging-Face-Spaces** repository! This repository serves as a central hub for all the projects and applications I have developed and deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). Each project folder contains the complete set of files and documentation for a specific Hugging Face Space application.

## Projects

### 1. **News Article Summarization**
This project is a text summarization application designed to generate concise summaries of news articles. It is built using Python and leverages Hugging Face's powerful models for natural language processing (NLP) and deployed as Spaces app on huggingface with **_gradio_**.

- **Folder Name:** `News-Article-Summarization`
- **Key Files:**
  - `app.py`: The main application file containing the logic for text summarization.
  - `requirements.txt`: The dependencies required to run the application.
  - `.gitattributes`: Configuration file for Git attributes.
  - `README.md`: Documentation specific to the News Article Summarization project.

## Future Projects
In the future, I plan to add more exciting projects to this repository, covering various domains and use cases. Stay tuned for updates!
